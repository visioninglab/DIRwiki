# DIR Case Study Wiki

A reference resource for studying how critical infrastructure systems around the world are designed, built, and governed to achieve resilience.

## Overview

The DIR (Designing Infrastructure for Resilience) Case Study Wiki catalogues real-world case studies across sectors — water, energy, transport, digital, and more — and evaluates them against a consistent set of resilience principles. The goal is to make infrastructure resilience knowledge accessible and comparable for researchers, policymakers, engineers, and students.

## Features

- **Structured Case Studies**: Each case study follows a consistent format covering overview, timeline, stakeholders, digitalization, hazards, costs, and resilience assessment
- **Resilience Framework**: All cases are evaluated against six Principles of Resilient Infrastructure
- **Comparative Analysis**: Standardized structure enables cross-sector and cross-geography comparison
- **Educational Resource**: Supports learning from diverse international approaches to infrastructure resilience

## Case Study Structure

Each case study includes:

- **Overview** — Summary of the infrastructure, its scale, and strategic purpose
- **Timeline & Location** — Key dates, phases, and geographical context
- **Stakeholders** — Ownership, governance, and parties involved
- **Digitalisation & Data** — Digital tools, sensors, and data systems
- **Hazards** — Exogenous and endogenous risks
- **Cost & Benefit** — Financial scale and value delivered
- **Resilience Principles Assessment** — Evaluation against the six principles
- **Futures** — Planned developments and emerging considerations

## Six Principles of Resilient Infrastructure

1. **Accountability** — Clear ownership and long-term governance
2. **Protected by Design** — Robustness, redundancy, and fail-safe engineering
3. **Environmentally Integrated** — Working with natural systems and resource efficiency
4. **Socially Engaged** — Community involvement and equitable outcomes
5. **Adaptive Management** — Capacity to evolve with changing conditions
6. **Continual Learning** — Systematic capture and application of lessons

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to explore the wiki. No build process or dependencies required.

## Current Case Studies

- **Singapore Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS)** — Large-scale underground wastewater management infrastructure

More case studies are planned and under development.

## Design

The wiki uses a clean, accessible design with:
- Custom CSS styling (no frameworks)
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Typography using Source Serif 4, DM Sans, and JetBrains Mono fonts
- Consistent color scheme with academic/professional aesthetic

## Contributing

Case studies marked as "Planned" are under development. Sections marked with **TO DO** badges indicate areas needing further research.

If you're interested in:
- Contributing a case study
- Providing additional data for existing entries
- Suggesting improvements to the framework
